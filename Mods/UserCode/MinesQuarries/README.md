## Mines and Quarries

Mines are Quarries are a sustainable, if resouce and calorie intensive, way to setup a continuous mining operation. No longer will you have to continuously mine further and further away from your claim in order to get more limestone and gold. You can place a mine or quarry down, and harvest those recipes infinitely. Don't jump on this too quickly though, using these objects in non-ideal ways could very well end up making you profit negative in the long run...

### Mines

Mines are objects that can infinitely mine a particular type of ore, while generally producing some kind of waste rock. They have lone craft times and high calorie costs. Mines require a wooden elevator to make, so they aren't available until mechanics.

There are 5 types of mine available right now: iron, copper, gold, coal, sulfur. The mine must be placed somewhere on top of the ore resource, no matter how deep that ore is under the mine. The ore can be one block beneath the mine, or 50, and the mine will still work. Caveat though, it will not continue to work if all the relavant blocks beneath it are mined. Which is to say, if you mine all of the gold ore under a gold mine, the gold mine will stop working. Additionally, most mines will need to be placed on top of multiple types of resource in order for them to function. You can see the types of resource on the mine's status window.

Each mine has 3 recipes: mooring rope, dynamite, and mining charge. These recipes are progressively more efficient at their job. They are also of course progressively more expensive. They are scaled such that (for example) a simple dynamite iron mining operation at AU0 will likely lose you money over time. Due to that, "vertical integration" is required to properly profit off of most of the mines (except for gold). You have to be strategic in your use of the mining recipes, that are intentionally less efficient than mining by hand.

### Quarries

Quarries are objects that can infinitely harvest a particular type of stone. Unlock mines, quarries produce 1 type of stone so there isn't any waste rock. Qaurries can be created with mortared stone, so they are available on day 1 ~ day 2.

There are 5 types of quarry available right now: Sandstone, Limestone, Granite, Shale. Placement of quarries is more strict than placement of mines. The quarry must be placed in an area that is primarily composed of the rock being harvested. In general you will not be able to place a quarry on a single limestone block. Instead you will need to place it against a limestone cliffside. 

The quarries take in stone pickaxes and produce their respective rock type. While this seems amazingly powerful on its face, you must also consider that it is a slow recipe with high calorie cost. As such, you will lose money on the average quarry at BU0 mining granite. You should become profitable at BU5 harvesting limestone, by contrast. Vertical integration is also key here. Being able to turn the rocks into products (mortared stone, limestone animals) will increase your profit margins, as will playing in a duo with someone who produces cooked food.
