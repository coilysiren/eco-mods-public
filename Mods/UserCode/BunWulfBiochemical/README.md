# BunWulf BioChemical

A mod that adds a Biochemist profession who's role is to go toe to toe with Oil Drilling. The Biochemist gets recipes to make Biodiesel, Plastic, Rubber, Epoxy, and Nylon. The recipes have similar costs to Oil Drilling, but the Biochemist is more sustainable and has a lower impact on the environment.

## Installation

Unzip the archive into the server root directory (where the executable lives). This will place all the files in their place automatically.

## Recipes

### Plastic Container Biofuel, 50% Ethanol

This recipe is strictly superior to the Oil Drilling recipe Biofuel, due to requiring "50%" of the ethanol that Oil Drilling requires, and doesn't require two professions to make. The recipe also uses a plastic container, presumably a plant based plastic container, to take iron out of the equation.

The recipe is 2 ethanol, 2 plastic => 1 biodiesel

### Plant Based Bioplastic

Uses vegetable and fat to replicate something like corn based PLA. It uses vegetable tag instead of corn to make the recipe easier to use. This recipe idea was what spawned the entire idea of this mod.

The recipe is 10 vegetable, 10 fat => 2 plastic

### Tree Rubber

A more complex recipe requiring Eco's largest tree type. This recipe uses Ceiba logs and fat to produce synthetic rubber.

The recipe is 40 ceiba log, 40 fat => 10 rubber

### Coal Fat Epoxy

This recipe uses coal and fat to make a more accessible version of Oil Drilling's Epoxy. Coal and fat were chosen to approximate some kind of "sticky" substance.

The recipe is 1 coal, 10 fat => 2 epoxy

### Coal Based Nylon

This recipe again uses coal and fat to create nylon. This recipe is based on the idea that nylon is a synthetic carbon based material.

The recipe is 1 coal, 10 fat => 8 nylon

### Ethanol

Creates Ethanol from any vegetable. The goal here is to make the Biochemist independent of Cutting Edge Cooking, which is unlocked at a higher tier.
